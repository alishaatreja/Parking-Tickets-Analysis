# Parking-Tickets-Analysis
The NYC Department of Finance collects data on every parking ticket issued in NYC (~10M per year!). This data is made publicly available to aid in ticket resolution and to guide policymakers.

Content Since the dataset is too large, I have analyzed only 2017 file. See the dataset descriptions for exact details. Columns include information about the vehicle ticketed, the ticket issued, location, and time.

Acknowledgements Data was produced by NYC Department of Finance. FY2018 data is found here with updates every third week of the month.

Analysis to be done : Where are tickets most commonly issued? When are tickets most likely to be issued? Any seasonality? What are the most types of cars to be ticketed?
